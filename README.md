# ViewmodelConfigGenerator

Creates viewmodel configs for ElDewrito for all weapons

Run the program with the output file name and 3 numbers for offsets as arguments
(e.g. "Quake 0.014 0.037 -0.057")
and it will output a .json file. 

Put the file in mods/weapons/offsets and update mods/weapons/offsets.json
